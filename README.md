### Sales Forecast Project for Siemens
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

This was a group project in academic context, but we were given real Data by Siemens Advanta. The projects was essentially based on 2 main datasets, one containing sales for 14 different groups of products and another one with 48 monthly market prices of raw materials and some other economic indexes. The project has successfully establisehd a data-driven basis to forecast Siemens Monthly sales.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
